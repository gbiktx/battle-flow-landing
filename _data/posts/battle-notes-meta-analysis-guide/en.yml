  Are you serious about climbing the **Pokémon GO PVP** ranks? Want to understand what's actually working in the meta and why your teams win or lose? Stop relying on guesswork and start using data to dominate **Great League**, **Ultra League**, and every competitive format.

  BattleFlow's **Battle Notes** and **Meta Analysis** features turn you into a data-driven competitor. Track every battle, analyze the meta in real-time, and discover exactly what it takes to win consistently in **Pokémon GO GBL**.

  ## 🗒️ Battle Notes: Your Personal PVP Battle Tracker

  Every competitive player knows that tracking your battles is essential for improvement. But manually logging battles in spreadsheets? That's tedious and time-consuming. BattleFlow's **Battle Notes** feature makes battle tracking effortless and insightful.

  ### What Are Battle Notes?

  **Battle Notes** is BattleFlow's intelligent battle tracking system that records your **GBL battles** with just a few taps. Track opponent teams, your team composition, battle outcomes, and ELO changes—all in one streamlined interface designed for competitive players.

  ### How Battle Notes Work

  After each **Pokémon GO PVP battle**, simply:

  1. **Record the opponent's team** - Tap to select their Lead, Safe Switch, and Closer
  2. **Select your team** - Choose from your saved teams or manually select your Pokémon
  3. **Log the result** - Mark Win or Loss
  4. **Track your ELO** - Record your current rating to see progression over time
  5. **Save instantly** - Your battle is logged and ready for analysis

  The entire process takes less than 15 seconds, keeping you focused on climbing ranks instead of managing spreadsheets.

  ### Why Battle Notes Matter for Your GBL Success

  **Track What You're Actually Facing**
  Wondering what's dominating the **Great League meta** this season? Battle Notes shows you exactly which Pokémon you're encountering most frequently. See if Azumarill is really everywhere or if Shadow Gligar has taken over as the top threat.

  **Understand Your Team's Performance**
  Which of your teams has the highest win rate? Battle Notes tracks performance for every team you use, showing you which compositions are actually winning battles—not just looking good on paper.

  **Identify Pattern Recognition**
  Notice you always lose when you see a certain lead matchup? Battle Notes reveals these patterns so you can adjust your strategy or team composition accordingly.

  **Measure Real Progress**
  Track your ELO progression over time. See your climb from 2000 to 2500 rating visualized with clear graphs and metrics. Celebrate your wins and learn from your losses with concrete data.

  ### Battle Notes Best Practices

  **Be Consistent** - Log every battle during your session. Partial data gives incomplete insights. The more battles you track, the more accurate your meta analysis becomes.

  **Record Immediately** - Log battles right after they finish while the details are fresh. This ensures accuracy and builds a complete battle history.

  **Track Your Team Changes** - When you swap team members, create a new team entry. This lets you compare performance between different team variations and identify which tweaks actually improve your results.

  **Monitor Multiple Formats** - Keep separate battle logs for Great League, Ultra League, and special cups. Each format has unique meta trends worth tracking independently.

  ## 📊 Meta Analysis: Decode the Competitive Landscape

  Battle Notes capture your battles—**Meta Analysis** transforms that data into actionable intelligence. This is where BattleFlow turns raw battle logs into strategic advantages.

  ### What Is Meta Analysis?

  **Meta Analysis** is BattleFlow's advanced analytics system that processes your battle history (and the broader community's data) to reveal exactly what's working in competitive **Pokémon GO PVP**. It's like having a professional analyst breaking down the meta for you after every battle session.

  ### Core Meta Analysis Features

  - **Safe Switch Usage** - Common pivot choices in the meta
  - **Closer Usage** - Popular finishing Pokémon

  This data updates based on your battle logs from the past 3 months, giving you current meta snapshots for **Great League**, **Ultra League**, and every cup format.

  **🏆 Your Best Teams**

  Meta Analysis automatically identifies your highest-performing teams based on:

  ### Lead Performance Insights: Your Secret Weapon

  One of Meta Analysis's most powerful features is **Lead Performance Insights**—advanced analytics showing how YOUR leads perform against common opponent leads.

  **What Lead Insights Show:**

  **Matchup Win Rates** - See your actual performance with each lead against the meta's top leads. Did you win 70% of your Lanturn vs. Azumarill leads? The data knows.

  **Favorable vs. Unfavorable Matchups** - Instantly identify which leads work well for you and which struggle. This helps you make informed decisions about team building and battle strategy.

  **Common Opponent Type Distributions** - Understand the type coverage you're facing most frequently. If you're seeing Water-types in 40% of leads, you better have an answer ready.

  **Performance by Pokémon** - Get granular data showing:
  - Your wins vs. losses with each lead
  - Win rate percentage against meta threats
  - Type matchup strengths and weaknesses
  - Actual battle outcomes vs. expected matchups

  This intelligence helps you answer critical questions:
  - Should I keep running Medicham as my lead in **Great League**?
  - Why do I keep losing the lead matchup with Talonflame?
  - Which of my leads has the best overall performance against the current meta?

  ### Team Building Insights

  Meta Analysis doesn't just show you data—it gives you **actionable advice**:

  - **Counter Recommendations** - Based on what you're facing, get suggestions for Pokémon that counter prevalent threats
  - **Meta Trend Analysis** - See if certain Pokémon are rising or falling in usage over time
  - **Coverage Optimization** - Identify type coverage gaps in commonly faced teams and build your team to exploit them
