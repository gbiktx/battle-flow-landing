  The difference between good and elite players in Pokémon GO PvP isn't luck—it's **precise charge move timing**. Understanding when to throw your charge moves based on move counts can mean the difference between winning and losing a match.

  In this guide, we'll cover everything you need to know about move counting, turn-based timing optimization, and energy management to dominate Go Battle League.

  ## Understanding Turn-Based Combat

  Pokémon GO PvP operates on a **turn-based system** where each turn lasts **0.5 seconds**. Every fast move takes a certain number of turns to complete:

  **Common Fast Move Turn Durations:**

  - **1 turn (0.5s):** Lock-On, Dragon Breath, Water Gun, Lick
  - **2 turns (1.0s):** Counter, Psycho Cut, Powder Snow, Mud Shot, Fury Cutter
  - **3 turns (1.5s):** Charm, Snarl, Gust
  - **4 turns (2.0s):** Confusion, Volt Switch, Yawn
  - **5 turns (2.5s):** Incinerate

  **Why This Matters:**
  When both players have a charge move ready, the player using the **faster fast move** gets to act first during the turn they both reach their charge move threshold.

  ## Charge Move Timing: The Core Concept

  The key question in every battle is: **"Should I throw my charge move NOW, or wait for one more fast move?"**

  Your decision depends on three factors:

  1. **Your fast move turn duration**
  2. **Opponent's fast move turn duration**
  3. **Both players' energy levels**

  ### Example: Turn Speed Advantage

  **Scenario:**

  - **You:** Using Counter (2 turns, 3 EPT)
  - **Opponent:** Using Confusion (4 turns, 3.5 EPT)

  You both need around 12-14 fast moves to reach your first charge move (40 energy).

  **The Math:**

  - **Your timing:** 14 Counters = 28 turns to reach Ice Punch (40 energy)
  - **Opponent timing:** 12 Confusions = 48 turns to reach Shadow Ball (45 energy)

  You reach your charge move **20 turns (10 seconds) earlier** than your opponent.

  **Optimal Strategy:**

  Since Counter takes 2 turns and Confusion takes 4 turns, Counter will align with Confusion completions at certain intervals.

  **How to count in practice:**
  1. Count your Counters: "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, **7**" ← 7th Confusion completes here
  2. Continue: "8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, **14**" ← Your Ice Punch is ready, their 7th Confusion just finished
  3. **Throw immediately after their 7th Confusion completes**

  **Why this works:** Your 14 Counters align with their 7 Confusions, so throwing here gives them zero free turns.

  **Practical tip:** Count THEIR Confusions as visual reference - throw right after you see their 7th Confusion animation complete.

  ### Example: Turn Speed Disadvantage

  **Scenario:**

  - **You:** Using Confusion (4 turns, 3.5 EPT)
  - **Opponent:** Using Counter (2 turns, 3 EPT)

  You need 13 Confusions (52 turns) to reach Shadow Ball (45 energy).
  They need 14 Counters (28 turns) to reach Ice Punch (40 energy).

  **The Problem:**
  They'll have their charge move ready much earlier than you.

  **Optimal Strategy:**

  - Accept you'll be forced to shield first
  - Count their Counters to predict when Ice Punch is ready
  - After shielding, you're only 6 more Confusions from Shadow Ball
  - Confusion's high damage (7 per turn) compensates for slower energy gain

  ## Move Counting Fundamentals

  Move counting is tracking your opponent's fast moves to predict when their charge move is ready.

  **BattleFlow helps you understand:**

  - **Move statistics** - Power, energy cost/gain, cooldown for all moves
  - **Battle simulations** - Automatic 1v1 simulations showing energy bars, HP, and damage per turn
  - **Turn-by-turn timeline** - See exactly how battles play out across 9 shield scenarios
  - **Pokemon stats** - Attack, Defense, HP, and optimal IVs for your league

  ### Basic Counting Formula

  ```
  Moves Needed = Charge Move Cost ÷ Fast Move EPT (rounded up)
  ```

  **Example: Medicham with Counter (3 EPT)**

  - Ice Punch (40 energy): 40 ÷ 3 = 13.3 → **14 Counters**

  After counting **14 Counters**, Ice Punch is ready.

  ### Practical Counting in Battle

  Most Pokémon run **two charge moves**—a cheap bait move and an expensive nuke.

  **Example: Swampert (Mud Shot - 4.5 EPT)**

  - **Hydro Cannon** (40 energy): 40 ÷ 4.5 = 8.9 → **9 Mud Shots**
  - **Earthquake** (55 energy): 55 ÷ 4.5 = 12.2 → **13 Mud Shots**

  **What to count:**

  1. Count to **9 Mud Shots** first (Hydro Cannon range)
  2. If they don't throw, keep counting
  3. At **13 Mud Shots**, Earthquake is ready
  4. After 13 Mud Shots, they might have BOTH moves stored

  ## Optimal Charge Move Timing

  **The Golden Rule:** Always throw on the **final turn of your opponent's fast move** to avoid giving them free turns.

  This applies to ALL strategies below - the timing principle stays the same, but your decision about WHEN to reach your charge move threshold changes based on the situation.

  ### Strategy 1: Throw on Threshold

  Reach your charge move energy threshold and throw on the **next completion of opponent's fast move**.

  **When to use:**

  - Your fast move is slower than opponent's
  - You're behind on energy
  - You need to force shields immediately
  - Opponent has no charge move ready yet

  **Example:**
  You're using Confusion. Opponent is using Counter.
  You reach Shadow Ball (45 energy) after 12 Confusions.

  Your 12th Confusion will complete at the same moment as their 24th Counter.

  **How to execute:** Count your Confusions. After your 12th Confusion animation completes, throw immediately—their Counter will have just completed too.

  ### Strategy 2: Overcharging for Energy

  Throw your charge move **later** to build extra energy for future matchups.

  **When to use:**

  - You're ahead in the matchup (opponent will faint soon)
  - You want energy stored for next Pokémon
  - Opponent is one fast move from fainting
  - You don't need the charge move to win

  **Example:**
  Your Medicham has opponent's Registeel down to 20 HP.
  You have Ice Punch ready (14 Counters, 42 energy).
  Registeel will faint from 4 more Counters anyway.

  **Option A:** Throw Ice Punch now
  → Registeel faints, you enter next matchup with **0 energy**

  **Option B:** Farm 4 more Counters
  → Registeel faints from fast move damage
  → You enter next matchup with **12 energy** (closer to another Ice Punch)

  **Correct play:** Option B. The extra energy is huge for the next matchup.

  ### Strategy 3: Optimal Throw Timing

  The most advanced timing strategy: throw your charge move **right after your opponent's fast move completes**.

  **Why this matters:**
  When you interrupt an opponent mid-fast-move, you give them **free turns**. They can sneak in extra damage while your charge move animation plays.

  **The Golden Rule:** Throw **immediately after** their fast move animation completes to prevent free turns.

  **Example: You vs Opponent Using Confusion**

  Confusion is a 4-turn move. You can SEE the Confusion animation.

  **Bad timing:** You throw while their Confusion animation is still playing

  - You interrupt their Confusion mid-animation
  - They get free turns during your charge move
  - They land extra fast move damage

  **Optimal timing:** You throw RIGHT AFTER you see their Confusion animation complete

  - Confusion just finished and damage registered
  - Your charge move starts immediately
  - Zero free turns given to opponent

  **How to track this:**
  Watch for their Confusion animation to finish, then throw immediately. Count their VISIBLE MOVE ANIMATIONS.

  **Advanced Example with Different Fast Move Speeds:**

  - You: Medicham with Counter
  - Opponent: Confusion user

  Every 2 Counters = 1 Confusion.

  **Best throw moments:** Right after you see their 2nd, 4th, 6th, or 8th Confusion animation complete.

  **Practical counting:**
  - Count THEIR Confusions: "1... 2... 3... 4..."
  - When you have your charge move ready AND their current Confusion completes → throw immediately

  **If your move doesn't align:** If you reach your charge move threshold mid-Confusion (e.g., after 7 Counters), wait for their current Confusion to finish before throwing.

  **Note:** This is nearly impossible in mirror matches where both players use the same fast move—you'll always interrupt each other.

  ## Energy Management in Practice

  ### Tracking Energy During Battle

  Always know:

  1. **Your energy level** (count your fast moves)
  2. **Opponent's energy level** (count their fast moves)
  3. **Who has energy advantage**

  **Energy advantage** = Having more stored energy than your opponent.

  **How to gain energy advantage:**

  - Use faster fast moves (higher EPT)
  - Farm down low-HP opponents
  - Force opponent to throw charge moves first
  - Win shield battles (make them waste energy)

  ### The Charge Move Priority (CMP) System

  When both players throw a charge move on the **same turn**, CMP decides who goes first.

  **CMP is decided by:**

  1. **Attack stat** (higher attack = priority)
  2. **If tied**: 50/50 random

  **Strategy if you WIN CMP:**

  - Throw when you reach threshold (on opponent's fast move completion)
  - You'll win the CMP tie and attack first
  - Control the pace of battle

  **Strategy if you LOSE CMP:**

  - **Option 1 (Throw Early):** Throw one fast move **before** the turn where you'd both have charge moves (still on their fast move completion) - avoids the CMP tie entirely
  - **Option 2 (Overcharge):** Throw one fast move **after** to gain energy advantage (still on their fast move completion)
  - **Option 3 (Undercharge Damage):** Intentionally miss attack bubbles during your charge move (don't hit "Excellent") to reduce damage and keep opponent alive longer for energy farming

  **Important:** "Undercharge" specifically means reducing your charge move's damage output by missing the attack minigame bubbles. This is NOT the same as throwing with less energy (Option 1).

  **Key:** Even when adjusting for CMP, always throw on opponent's fast move completion turn - just choose a DIFFERENT completion turn than where the CMP tie would occur.

  ### Managing Multiple Charge Moves

  Most competitive Pokémon run **two charge moves**:

  - **Cheap move** (35-40 energy) for baiting shields
  - **Expensive move** (50-65 energy) for raw damage

  **Effective shield baiting requires charging BOTH moves:**

  1. Build past your cheap move to reach your expensive move (e.g., 13 Mud Shots for Earthquake)
  2. Now you have **both Hydro Cannon AND Earthquake** ready
  3. **YOU must guess:** Will they shield or not?
  4. **If you think they WON'T shield:** Throw the expensive nuke (Earthquake) for massive damage
  5. **If you think they WILL shield:** Throw the cheap bait (Hydro Cannon) to waste their shield and save your nuke

  **Why this works:** Having both moves charged creates a **double guessing game**:

  - **Opponent thinks:** "Do they have both moves? Which will they throw?"
  - **You think:** "Will they shield? Should I bait or go for the nuke?"
  - This psychological pressure often forces them to shield, even on bait moves

  **BattleFlow helps you practice:**

  - Simulate different charge move strategies
  - See energy bars and turn counts during battles
  - Understand optimal shield usage across 9 scenarios
  - Analyze which charge moves to throw and when

  ### Example: Swampert Shield Bait Strategy

  **Your Swampert vs Opponent's Registeel**

  Swampert has Mud Shot (4.5 EPT), Hydro Cannon (40 energy), Earthquake (55 energy)

  **Phase 1: Build to both moves**

  - **9 Mud Shots** = 40.5 energy (Hydro Cannon ready)
  - **Continue to 13 Mud Shots** = 58.5 energy (both moves ready!)

  **Phase 2: The double guessing game**

  - You have **both Hydro Cannon AND Earthquake** charged
  - **You must decide:** Will they shield?
  - **If you think YES:** Throw Hydro Cannon (cheap bait) to waste their shield
  - **If you think NO:** Throw Earthquake (expensive nuke) for massive damage
  - In this scenario, an Earthquake will hit hard, so Registeel will probably shield → you throw Hydro Cannon bait

  **Phase 3: Reload and finish**

  - **9 more Mud Shots** = Hydro Cannon ready again
  - Registeel has no shields left
  - Throw unshielded Hydro Cannon for the knockout

  **Key lesson:** By building past the cheap move to charge both moves, you forced your opponent into a guessing game they couldn't win.

  ## Common Timing Mistakes

  ### Mistake 1: Not Tracking Opponent Move Counts

  **Bad Play:**
  You focus only on your own energy and forget to count opponent's fast moves.
  Opponent surprises you with a charge move when you thought they needed "a few more moves."

  **Fix:** Count **both** your moves and opponent's moves simultaneously. Know when they'll reach their charge move thresholds.

  ### Mistake 2: Throwing on Bad Turn Timing

  **Bad Play:**
  You throw your charge move while opponent is mid-fast-move animation.
  You give them 1-2 free turns to sneak extra damage during your charge move.

  **Fix:** Throw on the **last turn** of their fast move (when damage registers) to avoid giving free turns.

  ### Mistake 3: Not Building to Both Moves

  **Bad Play:**
  You throw Hydro Cannon immediately at 9 Mud Shots.
  Opponent knows it's the cheap move and doesn't shield.
  You must rebuild from 0 energy.

  **Fix:** Build to **13 Mud Shots** to have both moves ready. Force opponent to guess and respect the expensive move threat.

  ## Practice Drills

  ### Drill 1: Count Out Loud

  Pick a Pokémon (e.g., Medicham with Counter).
  Count out loud during battles: "1, 2, 3... 14" (Ice Punch ready).
  Note which move number reaches your threshold.

  ### Drill 2: Track Opponent Moves

  In your next GBL set, focus on ONE opponent Pokémon.
  Count their fast moves.
  Predict when their charge move is coming.
  Check if you were right.

  ### Drill 3: Timing Optimization

  In practice battles, experiment with WHEN to reach your charge move (always throwing on opponent's fast move completion):

  - **Threshold timing:** Reach charge move at optimal energy, throw on next opponent fast move completion
  - **Early timing:** Reach charge move one fast move early, throw on next opponent fast move completion
  - **Late timing (overcharge):** Build extra energy, throw on later opponent fast move completion

  Remember: The strategy determines WHEN you reach your energy threshold, but you ALWAYS throw on opponent's fast move completion to avoid giving free turns.

  Note which energy strategy feels best in different matchups.

  ## Conclusion
